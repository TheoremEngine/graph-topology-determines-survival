This repository provides the scripts used in the paper "Graph Topology Determines Survival in the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game." The scripts are:

* run.py: This performs the actual experiments.
* analyze\_1.py: This calculates the survival curves and critical mobility thresholds, as well as generating the seeds for the pattern-specific initializations.
* analyze\_2.py: This calculates the median durations of different patterns.
